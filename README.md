# Soccer Data Analytics Hackathon - Getting Started

**Event Dates:** February 27–28, 2026  
**Location:** Northeastern University / Network Science Institute  
**Supported by:** PySport

## Overview

This repository outlines our starter code for our shot decision quality metric. We used a variety of different attacking features such as shot angle, trajectory, position, and shot speed to determine the metric. Shot deciison quality (SDQ) can be used to determine what makes a "good" shot, with it being given a quantitative value on our own scale.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Impact OPEN Data
- Kloppy, pandas, mpl soccer

## Challenge Tasks

- **Logistic Regression Model**
  Predict what shots result in a goal, create a confusion matrix and other associated evalutation metrics

- **SDQ Implementation**
  Implement our SDQ class into the practical data and get quantitative values back. Test how accurate SDQ value by observing its relationship with result (goal or not)



## Challenge Prompts (Choose One)


### Option B: Transparent Player Valuation Metric
Define an interpretable attacking or defensive metric using event data. Create a metric definition, produce a leaderboard comparing players, present a case study, and discuss limitations.
