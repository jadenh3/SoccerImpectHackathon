# Soccer Data Analytics Hackathon - Getting Started

**Event Dates:** February 27–28, 2026  
**Location:** Northeastern University / Network Science Institute  
**Supported by:** PySport

## Overview

This repository outlines our starter code for our shot decision quality metric. We used a variety of different attacking features such as shot angle, trajectory, position, and shot speed to determine the metric. Shot deciison quality (SDQ) can be used to determine what makes a "good" shot, with it being given a quantitative value on our own scale.
