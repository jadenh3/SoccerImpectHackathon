# Soccer Data Analytics Hackathon - Getting Started

**Event Dates:** February 27–28, 2026  
**Location:** Northeastern University / Network Science Institute  
**Supported by:** PySport

## Overview

This repository outlines our starter code for our shot decision quality metric. We used a variety of different attacking features such as shot angle, trajectory, position, and shot speed to determine the metric. Shot deciison quality (SDQ) can be used to determine what makes a "good" shot, with it being given a quantitative value on our own scale. 

This differs from a stat like expected goals (xG) as xG measures the probability of a shot ending up in a goal, whilst SDQ measures the quality of the decision to shoot. Expected Goals helps to answer the question "How likely is this shot to end up in a goal?" On the other hand, SDQ helps to answer "Was taking this shot the right decision?"

### Prompt: Transparent Player Valuation Metric
Define an interpretable attacking or defensive metric using event data. Create a metric definition, produce a leaderboard comparing players, present a case study, and discuss limitations.


## AI Usage:
AI was used as a minor helper in the ideation of SDQ, deciding what features to use for feature engineering, and partly in the creation of the dashboard.
