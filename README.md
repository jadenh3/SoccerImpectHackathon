# Soccer Data Analytics Hackathon - Getting Started

**Event Dates:** February 27–28, 2026  
**Location:** Northeastern University / Network Science Institute  
**Supported by:** PySport

## Overview

This repository provides starter code and instructions for the Soccer Data Analytics Hackathon. You'll work with **IMPECT Open Data** containing 306 German Bundesliga matches from the 2023/24 season to tackle one of two challenge prompts.

## Challenge Prompts (Choose One)

### Option A: Starting Eleven Lineup Construction
Recommend an optimal starting eleven and/or substitution plan to maximize team cohesion and ball progression. Build a player-to-player pass network, analyze network structure, and compare alternative lineups with clear visualizations.

### Option B: Transparent Player Valuation Metric
Define an interpretable attacking or defensive metric using event data. Create a metric definition, produce a leaderboard comparing players, present a case study, and discuss limitations.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation (within Jupyter notebook)

```bash
!pip install "kloppy>=3.18.0" polars pyarrow
```

### 2. Explore the Notebook

Open `getting-started.ipynb` to see examples of:
- Loading matches and squad data
- Filtering for specific event types (passes, shots)
- Transforming coordinate systems
- Exporting to Polars/Pandas DataFrames
